// Hook is a hook to be called when something happens in kgo.
//
// The base Hook interface is useless, but wherever a hook can occur in kgo,
// the client checks if your hook implements an appropriate interface. If so,
// your hook is called.
//
// This allows you to only hook in to behavior you care about, and it allows
// the client to add more hooks in the future.
//
// All hook interfaces in this package have Hook in the name. Hooks must be
// safe for concurrent use. It is expected that hooks are fast; if a hook needs
// to take time, then copy what you need and ensure the hook is async.
